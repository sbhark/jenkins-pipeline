# jenkins-pipeline

## Description 

A collection of Jenkins pipelines for various languages. The pipelines are very barebones and basic but extensible and completely customizable.

## Installation 
If you will like to use this project without any modification then follow the instructions here: 
* https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries

However, I highly recommend you create a fork and customize the pipeline according to your needs and requirements. Using your forked version follows the same steps as above.
